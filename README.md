#STEPIK_course_WEB-TECHNOLOGIES
study project from mail.ru
# First project -
	- create git repository on github.com
	- create folders
	- create nginx configuration file
	- create shell script for deploying
I did it on the first try (with fast bug fixing)

#Second project - 
	- create simple wsgi app (print query strings)
	- launch gunicorn
	- tests
	- deploy
Again on the first try, because i'm testing it locally before deploying it to a test server
